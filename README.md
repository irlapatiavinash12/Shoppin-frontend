Key Concepts and Best Practices

Component-Based Design

Each feature is encapsulated in its own React component.

Promotes reusability and clean code structure.

State Management

Local state is used for handling selections and updating the preview dynamically.

Animations

CSS animations enhance the user experience with smooth transitions and hover effects.

Responsiveness

The design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

Challenges Faced

Ensuring Pixel Perfection: Achieving a design that closely matches the original Apple Watch Studio required careful attention to detail.

Dynamic Updates: Implementing real-time updates for the watch preview and price calculation.

Carousel Navigation: Creating a smooth and intuitive carousel for band selection.

Future Enhancements

User Authentication: Allow users to save and revisit their configurations.

Backend Integration: Connect to a database for storing saved configurations.

AR Preview: Explore the possibility of adding an augmented reality preview feature.
